    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Lasagna is an Italian classic for the ages. Originating from Naples, Italy in the Middle Ages. Most people you
        know will have childhood memories of a homecooked lasagna. Personally, it brings me memories of my Mum making us
        Lasagna on our birthday dinner nights.</p>

    <p>The rich tomato sauce breaking up the crisp pasta layers, it's a dish that anybody should have at least once in
        their life. Without further ado, <strong>how to make a lasagna.</strong></p>

    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Meat:</strong> Italian sausage and lean ground beef. (Use mushrooms for a vegetarian alternate)</li>
        <li><strong>Aromatics:</strong> An onion and two cloves of garlic to cook with the meat.</li>
        <li><strong>Tomatoes:</strong> A can of crushed tomatoes, two cans of tomato sauce and two cans of tomato paste.
            For the sauce.</li>
        <li><strong>Sweetness:</strong> At least two tablespoons of white sugar to balance the tomatoes.</li>
        <li><strong>Seasonings:</strong> Fresh parsley, dried basil, salt, italian herbs, fennel seeds and black pepper.
            For a bit of flavour</li>
        <li><strong>Pasta:</strong> Lasagna sheets, fresh or store bought.</li>
        <li><strong>Cheese:</strong> Parmesan, mozzarella and ricotta cheese.</li>
        <li><strong>Egg:</strong> A single egg.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps:</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Cook off the aromatics before adding your meat of choice.</li>
        <li>Add the tomato elements and simmer them off for 10 minutes. Add the sugar to lower the tartness of the tomatoes if needed.</li>
        <li>Season the sauce to taste.</li>
        <li>Let the sauce simmer whilst preparing the lasagna sheets.</li>
        <li>Mix the egg with the ricotta. (This will allow the ricotta to hold it's shape better)</li>
        <li>Before layering the lasagna, cover the base of the lasagna dish with a small amount of sauce. (Will prevent the lasagna sticking to the base)</li>
        <li>Begin layering the lasagna. The order being pasta sheet then meat sauce then ricotta then some parmessan and mozzarella slices.</li>
        <li>Repeat the layering until a small amount of meat sauce and ricotta remains.</li>
        <li>For the final layer place meat sauce then top with ricotta. Then cover the top with the parmesan and mozzarella, this will give you that golden brown top.</li>
        <li>Cover the finished lasagna with alfoil wrap.</li>
        <li>Place the covered lasagna into a 190&deg;C preheated oven. Cook for a total of 50 minutes, 25 minutes covered and 25 minutes uncovered. (The top of the lasagna should be golden brown at this point, cook longer uncovered if need for colour)</li>
        <li>After pulling the lasagna from the oven, allow it to sit for 15 minutes to cool. (If you don't slices will not hold their shape)</li>
        <li>Serve the lasagna. (Accompanying with some garlic bread is common)</li>
    </ol>
